# Operation Dolphin: Echoes of the Mesozoic

Operation Dolphin: Echoes of the Mesozoic blends the chaos of the Vietnam War with genetically engineered dinosaurs, creating a pulpy, adrenaline-fueled narrative. Set in 1968, you play as Captain Jack "Marlin" Kowalski, a MACV-SOG operative tasked with infiltrating a CIA black site codenamed Warehouse X-Ray deep in the Annamite jungles of Laos. The mission: recover Project DOLPHIN's classified filesâ€”a blueprint for weaponized dinosaurs engineered to destabilize North Vietnamese supply lines along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

## The Story

### The CIA's Phoenix Program

The CIA's Phoenix Program secretly expanded into bioweapon research after discovering preserved Tyrannosaurus rex DNA in Cambodian cave systems. Scientists spliced dinosaur genes with modern reptiles, creating hyper-aggressive hybrids deployed to terrorize Vietcong forces. But when the dinosaurs broke containment, the CIA abandoned the facility, leaving behind:

- **Project DOLPHIN's Master File**: Details genetic modifications, control protocols, and a list of embedded double agents in Hanoi's politburo.

- **Agent Orange-X**: A mutagenic variant that accelerated dinosaur growth, causing erratic behavior and Baryonyx packs to stalk U.S. patrols.
